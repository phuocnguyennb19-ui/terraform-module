    and for Fargate. "instance" is for EC2 behind an autoscaling group.

    Targets themselves are attached outside this module — by the controller in
    Kubernetes, or by an ASG's target_group_arns. That is why create_attachment
    defaults to false: the module creates the group, something else fills it.
